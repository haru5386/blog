# Getting Started with Next.js and MDX

Next.js is a powerful React framework that makes building web applications a breeze. In this post, we'll explore how to create a blog using Next.js and MDX.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js provides several benefits out of the box:

- Server-side rendering
- Static site generation
- API routes
- File-system based routing
- Built-in TypeScript support

## Setting up MDX

MDX allows you to use React components directly in your markdown files. Here's a simple example:

```jsx
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button'

# Welcome to my blog

<Button>Click me!</Button>
```

## Conclusion

Building a blog with Next.js and MDX is a great way to create content-driven websites. The combination of React's component model and markdown's simplicity makes for an excellent developer experience.
